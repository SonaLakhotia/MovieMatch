# 🌍 MovieMatch: Because great movies deserve less debate.

### ✨ A smarter way to decide what to watch — built for friends across cultures

## 🎬 Problem It Solves

My friends and I come from different parts of the world. Every time we wanted to watch a movie together, the decision process turned into chaos — cultural preferences clashed, recommendations got lost in translation, and we ended up writing movie names on **chits** and drawing them out of a bowl. Random? Yes. Fair? Maybe. Satisfying? Rarely.

That's where **MovieMatch** comes in.

## ✅ What It Does

**MovieMatch** helps globally diverse friend groups like ours **find the most popular and highly rated movies in their area**. With real-time search, localized data, and easy-to-understand ratings, you’ll spend less time arguing — and more time watching.
